Course,Course Description
Accelerated Chemistry,"In Accelerated Chemistry, we covered the topics of atomic structure, bonding, chemical nomenclature, periodic properties, stoichiometry, solution phenomena, behavior of gasses. This semester, we had daily homework and multiple quizzes, along with a final assessment on titration."
Biology,"In Biology this semester, we emphasized evolution as the central organizing theory explaining the development and diversity of life on Earth. We learned how to use tenets of physics and chemistry to study such topics as the origins of life, population ecology, biochemistry, cellular organization, cell division, molecular genetics, Mendelian and population genetics, speciation, biogeography, sociobiology, and ecological energetics and ecosystem dynamics."
Genetics,"In Genetics this semester, we explored the science of heredity, including Mendelian and non-Mendelian patterns of inheritance. In addition, we covered topics such as gene structure and function, gene mutations, gene therapy versus gene editing, biotechnological applications, and the ethical implications such work brings. Next semester, we will dive into topics including genetically modified products, DNA fingerprinting and forensics, and personal genomics. "
