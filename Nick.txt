In Accelerated Chemistry, we covered the topics of atomic structure, bonding, chemical nomenclature, periodic properties, stoichiometry, solution phenomena, behavior of gasses. This semester, we had daily homework and multiple quizzes, along with a final assessment on titration.
Nick, this semester you exceeded at Learning Outcome 7: "Engaging in Argument from Evidence". You have consistently utilized evidence to support your scientific claims and hypotheses. Your ability to construct compelling arguments supported by data and reasoning demonstrates an analytical mindset and critical thinking skills.
Nick, additional focus on Learning Outcome 2: "Developing and Using Models" will help with your continued growth. Although you have demonstrated an ability to translate abstract concepts into tangible representations, I'd like to see you take it one step further and think about how you can use those models further in other scientific applications.
The topic of Accelerated Chemistry's final this semester was titration. Nick, you received a 3.75 out of 4 on the final. Wonderful work! Some small errors, but overall you showed very solid understanding of the material. Most impressively, you were able to accurately apply learned concepts to new and challenging scenarios.
Nick, you are a joy to have in class. However, please limit your side conversations as they frequently throw the class off track. Although, you are loved and appreciated by all, continue to thrive next semester!! 
Your final grade is: A-. You have a strong grasp of the material and consistently demonstrate critical thinking skills.
To end the semester off with a bang, here is a fun joke for you: Wanna hear a joke about potassium? K
